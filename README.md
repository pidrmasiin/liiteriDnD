# Map (components)

Drag the guy to the cottage and get the applauds. For this I have used Drag and Drop library with the touch backend. http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/ 

# Cyclist

Touch the screen and get applauds. I have used TweenMax with this one. https://greensock.com/tweenmax 

# Backend

Node + mongoose. I made a production build from the frontend and used express to view it. https://github.com/pidrmasiin/liiteriback

To get the backend work you have to make a production build from the frontend with "npm run build" command. In the backend replace the old build folder with the new one and the backend should works.
